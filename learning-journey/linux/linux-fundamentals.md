# Linux Fundamentals: A Comprehensive Guide

Linux, the open-source operating system that powers everything from smartphones to supercomputers, has become an essential skill for developers, system administrators, and IT professionals. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamental concepts and practical skills needed to master Linux system administration and operations.

## 1. Basic Commands

### File System Navigation
The Linux file system is hierarchical, starting from the root directory (/). Essential navigation commands include:
```bash
pwd     # Print Working Directory
cd      # Change Directory
ls      # List Directory Contents
ls -la  # List with detailed information
```

### File Operations
Mastering file operations is crucial for daily tasks:
```bash
cp source destination    # Copy files
mv source destination    # Move/Rename files
rm filename             # Remove files
mkdir directory         # Create directories
touch filename         # Create empty files
```

### Text Processing
Linux provides powerful text processing tools:
```bash
cat filename           # Display file contents
grep "pattern" file    # Search for patterns
sed 's/old/new/' file  # Stream editor for text manipulation
awk '{print $1}' file  # Pattern scanning and processing
```

### System Information
Monitor and understand your system
```bash
uname -a              # System information
df -h                 # Disk space usage
free -h               # Memory usage
top                   # Process monitoring
```

### Process Management
Control and monitor system processes:
```bash
ps aux               # List all processes
kill PID             # Terminate a process
killall process_name # Kill processes by name
nice -n 10 command   # Run command with modified priority
```

## 2. File System

### Directory Structure
Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
- `/` - Root directory
- `/bin` - Essential user commands
- `/etc` - System configuration files
- `/home` - User home directories
- `/var` - Variable data files
- `/usr` - User utilities and applications

### File Permissions
Linux uses a robust permission system:
```bash
chmod 755 file    # Set permissions (rwxr-xr-x)
chmod u+x file    # Add execute permission for user
ls -l             # View permissions
```

### Ownership
Manage file ownership and groups
```bash
chown user:group file    # Change owner and group
chgrp group file         # Change group only
```

### Links
Two types of links in Linux
```bash
ln -s target link_name   # Create symbolic link
ln target link_name      # Create hard link
```

### Mount Points
Manage storage devices
```bash
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt    # Mount a device
umount /mnt             # Unmount a device
df -h                   # Show mounted filesystems
```

## 3. User Management

### User Accounts
Create and manage user accounts
```bash
useradd username        # Create new user
passwd username         # Set password
userdel username        # Delete user
```

### Groups
Manage user groups
```bash
groupadd groupname      # Create new group
usermod -aG group user  # Add user to group
groupdel groupname      # Delete group
```

### Permissions
Understanding permission types
- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

### sudo Access
Configure administrative privileges
```bash
visudo                 # Edit sudoers file
sudo command           # Run command as superuser
```

### Authentication
Security best practices:
- Use strong passwords
- Implement PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
- Configure SSH key-based authentication

## 4. Process Management

### Process Monitoring
Tools for process monitoring:
```bash
top                    # Interactive process viewer
htop                   # Enhanced process viewer
ps aux                 # Process status
```

### Job Control
Manage background processes
```bash
command &              # Run in background
fg %job_number         # Bring to foreground
bg %job_number         # Continue in background
```

### Service Management
Control system services
```bash
systemctl start service    # Start a service
systemctl stop service     # Stop a service
systemctl status service   # Check service status
```

### Systemd
Modern init system
```bash
systemctl list-units      # List all units
systemctl enable service  # Enable service at boot
systemctl disable service # Disable service at boot
```

### Logs
System logging
```bash
journalctl              # View system logs
tail -f /var/log/syslog # Monitor log file
```

## 5. Shell Scripting

### Basic Scripting
Create executable scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### Variables
Working with variables
```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name"
```

### Control Structures
Conditional statements and loops
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    commands
elif [ condition ]; then
    commands
else
    commands
fi

for i in {1..5}; do
    echo $i
done
```

### Functions
Create reusable code blocks
```bash
function_name() {
    local var="local variable"
    echo "Function body"
}
```

### Automation
Schedule tasks:
```bash
crontab -e              # Edit crontab
crontab -l              # List crontab
```
